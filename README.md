# es6 webpack boilerplate

es6 webpack boilerplate with unit test/formatter/linter setup

## Setup

```sh
$ npm install
```

## Development

This command will run on local with hot-reload at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/). Browser tab will open automatically.

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

## Unit Test

The following command will run unit tests, and output coverage report.

```sh
$ npm run test
```

## Deployment

Generate production-ready build (bundled and minified).

```sh
$ npm run build
```

## Code Style

ESLint & Prettier dev-dependency as well as config files (.eslintrc & .prettierrc) are included in this project. After `npm install`, linting and formating can be fully integrated with IDE/Text Editor by install plugins (like on VSCode or Webstorm). My code fully passed linting rules, and fully formatted.
